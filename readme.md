This repository provides the data (the data are available on [Landcare Research data store](https://datastore.landcareresearch.co.nz/dataset/waitutu-sortie-nz-2001-2008)) and the R scripts for the parametrisation of the SORTIE/NZ marine terrace sites as used in Kunstler et al. (2013) [link](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13595-012-0256-6)et Forsyth et al. (2015) [link](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1890/14-0389.1/abstract).

Each folder contains the data and the R scripts need to reproduce the analysis.

**TODO update scripts to work with downloaded data from Landcare website and other folder that adult.**

# Folder adult_growth_and_mortality

- data.adult.csv National Vegetation Survey used.

- data.adult.metadata.csv Metadata

- adult.growth.R R script for adult growth models

- adult.survival.R R script for adult survival models
